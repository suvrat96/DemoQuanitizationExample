README:


train.py: Skeleton training script for training a pytorch model. 
Needs modification to incorporate validation set/checkpointing/etc. For reference. 

benchmark_quantization.py: Run it to see gains in memory/inference times. 
It currently initializes a random model, but ideally there should be a load state_dict step for loading in pretrained weights and then evaluating the metrics for the pretrained model and the quantized model.
